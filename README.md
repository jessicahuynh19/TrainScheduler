# TrainScheduler

##Overview
The objective of this project is to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Installing

When you have accessed the repository page on GitHub, you may simply download a Zip file and extract it to a directory of your choosing. Alternatively, you may download the data directly to your device via GitBash or Terminal if you have an SSH key. More on adding an SSH key can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

To download via GitBash/Terminal, once you have a working SSH key with GitHub, create a folder you wish to download data into. Next, click on the green 'Download or Clone' button on the GitHub respoitory page. Make sure you have SSH key selected(and not HTTPS), and click on the clipboard icon. This copies the address to your clipboard. Personally, I use SSH key but if you'd rather use HTTPS here is a link that will instruct you on using HTTPS over SSH https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use

Next, navigate to the folder you wish to download the data into via GitBash or Terminal, and then simply type "git clone" followed by the SSH or the HTTPS URL. Press the enter key, and GitBash/Terminal will pull the entire repository needed.
